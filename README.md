# packer-unattended_distrib_files

In this repository, you will find some files that contains answers to automatic distribution installs.

This files are templates for packer and packer must send value for variables.

We assume in this repository that
    - we dont use dhcp and we specify static network informations.
    - packer is in charge of the provisioning so files instructions are minimalist.

For each distrib we will show an exemple of packer configuration in order to deploy and reuse this files for multiple sites.
